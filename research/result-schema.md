# Normalized Research Result Schema

**Schema status:** research 0.2

This document defines the information that every Phase 0 sample result must contain.
It is a research interchange model, not yet the product's public JSON contract.

Version 0.2 adds rule-level compatibility evidence and separates manual static
inspection from future analyzer execution.

## Top-level record

```yaml
schema_version: "0.2"
sample: {}
review: {}
manual_baseline: {}
evidence: []
compatibility: []
analyzer_runs: []
normalized_findings: []
disagreements: []
limitations: []
```

## Sample identity

```yaml
sample:
  corpus_id: ASL-C001
  name: example
  repository: owner/repository
  commit: full-commit-sha
  skill_root: path/to/skill
  skill_md_blob_sha: git-blob-sha
  git_tree_sha: git-tree-sha
  inventory_sha256: sha256
  license:
    identifier: SPDX-or-recorded-value
    evidence: path
```

The admitted sample must identify its corpus ID, immutable repository commit, skill
root, recursive inventory identity, license evidence, and exact `SKILL.md` blob. A
`SKILL.md` hash alone is insufficient because scripts and references can change
independently.

## Manual review

```yaml
review:
  review_id: ASL-C001-manual-001
  mode: static_manual
  reviewer: identifier
  reviewed_at: ISO-8601-date-or-timestamp
  source_access: pinned-git-objects
  content_installed: false
  content_executed: false
  sample_urls_contacted: false
  secret_values_accessed: false
```

Manual review records what was and was not done. It must not be represented as an
analyzer run with an invented command, exit code, duration, or execution environment.

## Manual baseline

```yaml
manual_baseline:
  frontmatter_fields: []
  files:
    total: 0
    scripts: []
    references: []
    assets: []
    package_manifests: []
    symlinks: []
  declared_capabilities: []
  inferred_capabilities: []
  external_urls: []
  environment_variable_names: []
  command_references: []
  observations: []
```

This section is descriptive. A capability may be inferred from explicit prose or a
command reference, but inference must be labeled and must not imply availability,
permission, safety, or successful execution.

## Evidence

```yaml
evidence:
  - id: ASL-C001-E001
    location:
      path: SKILL.md
      start_line: 1
      end_line: 4
    fact: Bounded quotation, paraphrase, or structured fact.
    supports_rules: [AS-PKG-001, AS-DOC-001]
```

Evidence must be bounded and must not reproduce unnecessary third-party content.
Inventory evidence may point to `corpus.yml` or `inventories.yml`. Every applied rule
must reference evidence or state why evidence is unavailable.

## Compatibility result

```yaml
compatibility:
  - profile: agent-skills
    profile_version: "research-0.1"
    target_version: specification-blob-identifier
    surface: core
    layers:
      package_structure: compatible
      platform_packaging: not_applicable
      capability_availability: unknown
      behavioral_conformance: not_tested
      operational_suitability: unknown
    rules:
      AS-PKG-001:
        result: pass
        confidence: high
        evidence_refs: [ASL-C001-E001]
        remediation: null
    not_applicable_rules: []
    skipped_rules: []
    observations: []
```

Each compatibility entry identifies one profile surface. Platform profiles may use
separate entries or surface-specific fields when runtime, publication, import, or
distribution results differ.

Allowed layer result values:

- `compatible`
- `compatible_with_conditions`
- `incompatible`
- `unknown`
- `not_applicable`
- `not_tested`

Allowed rule result values:

- `pass`
- `fail`
- `conditional`
- `unknown`
- `not_applicable`
- `not_tested`

`not_applicable_rules` must list every excluded rule ID or documented rule group.
`skipped_rules` requires a reason; it must not be used to hide missing evidence.

## Analyzer run

```yaml
analyzer_runs:
  - engine: example
    engine_version: 1.2.3
    rule_version: identifier-or-hash
    command: ["example", "scan", "/sample"]
    mode: static
    content_executed: false
    content_uploaded: false
    network: disabled
    exit_code: 0
    duration_ms: 0
    raw_output_sha256: hash
    status: completed
    skipped_checks: []
    errors: []
```

Analyzer runs remain empty during the manual-baseline stage. When scanners are later
approved, their actual command, environment, data flow, exit status, duration, and raw
output identity must be recorded.

## Normalized finding

```yaml
normalized_findings:
  - id: ASL-F-0001
    source:
      type: manual
      engine: null
      original_id: null
    category: compatibility.missing-resource
    severity: medium
    confidence: high
    compatibility_layers: [platform-packaging]
    targets: [hermes-agent]
    location:
      path: SKILL.md
      start_line: 10
      end_line: 12
    evidence_refs: [ASL-C001-E001]
    explanation: Why the evidence matters.
    remediation: Proposed action.
    disposition: unresolved
```

Allowed dispositions:

- `unresolved`
- `confirmed`
- `rejected_false_positive`
- `accepted_risk`
- `duplicate`
- `out_of_scope`
- `insufficient_evidence`

## Disagreement record

```yaml
disagreements:
  - id: ASL-D-0001
    finding_refs: [ASL-F-0001, ASL-F-0002]
    type: different-rule-scope
    summary: Concise description.
    resolution: unresolved
    evidence_refs: []
    reviewers: []
```

## Stability rules

- Preserve original engine identifiers and raw output hashes.
- Never merge findings in a way that removes provenance.
- Never convert `unknown` into `compatible`.
- Never infer `safe` from an empty finding list.
- Keep profile surfaces and compatibility layers separate.
- Record absent optional fields as `not_applicable`, not `pass`.
- Schema changes must be versioned and documented.
- Human-readable reports must be derivable from the normalized record.
